Config/Abstract version 0.10
============================

Config::Abstract is not supposed to be used directly, but rather as
the base class for a bundle of file format specific classes sharing
the internal representation of the file data that lets us perform a
bunch of operations on that data, such as converting files from one
format to any other format, creating diffs between config  files of
different formats, patching files based on keys-values, rather than
line numbers and so on.
